Thread One:
Experiment one - The three threads are started gradually and count down from from 5.
The limit (sleep time) given gives the threads enough time to exit before the main
thread since it sleeps for 10 seconds while the threads count down.

Experiment two - Same as Experiment one but with a shorter limit thus causing the main
to exit before the other three. The main exits but since the other threads continue to
run individually the count down continues into experiment 3.

Experiment three - Same as experiment two but now the main has a way shorter sleep
so it exits right after the threads from experiment two. The remaining threads continue
iterating until they are finished with their cycles.



Thread Two: In this experiment all four threads are started still started gradually but
in between the start method so the difference goes unnoticed. They then sleep for 5 seconds
before exiting.



Thread Two Array: Creates an array of 10 threads that start one after the other an then
starts an array of 20 threads they all ends at different points in time due to the sleep
time given.



Thread Two HashMap: Runs a HashMap of threads that don't start in order since the threads
in the map are stored based off of their Hash id rather than their name and exit based on
the same logic.



Thread Two HashMap Broken: The thread
